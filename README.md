## Problem Statement

You are working as a data scientist in the Walmart. Walmart has asked you to develop a model for one of the retail store in Boulder. If they like your work, they will ask you to replicate the model for other Walmart retail stores as well 
You would like to develop a model to get sense of customers and classify them into different cohorts/groups 
You are given the following attributes for 2000 customers (based on the Loyalty card they use at checkout)


- Customer ID
- Sex/Gender
- Martial Status
- Education
- Income
- Occupation (Unskilled/Skilled/Highly skilled)
- Settlement Size (The size of the city that the customer lives in)


The model should be able to classify customers into different cohorts so that suitable marketing strategies can be used for individual cohort
